## Lesson

### What is JavaScript?

HTML is the content, CSS is the styling, JS is the interactivity.  JS causes things to happen when users interact with a webpage with their mouse and keyboard.  JS makes things dynamic (not always the same website every time).

### Ways to trigger JavaScript to run

- On page load (runs entire script not inside of a function
- On events (events are when user interaction happens like clicking or typing, and we can fire functions when they happen)
- - `onClick` method with button (Show example)

### How to use JavaScript

2 Types:
- Inline JavaScript + Example
- Separate File JavaScript + Example (we'll stick to this one, it's industry standard)

### Overview of JavaScript

- Has variables, functions, classes, just like any language

### JavaScript Functions
- `alert()`
- `confirm()`
- `addEventListener()` - (Show variation example of hooking up button, except by using `addEventListener` instead of `onClick`)

### JavaScript Variables
- `const` (Constant/Final, can't change) & `let` (able to change)
- Possible variable types: 
- - `boolean`
- - `number`
- - `string`
- - `object`
- - `array`

### DOM Manipulation
- `document.title = 'This Website` (Change document title)
- `thisElement.innerHTML = '<h1>Hello</h1>'` (Change element inner HTML contents)
